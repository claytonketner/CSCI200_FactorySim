* The factory display lags because our image drawing method is rather inefficient. Unfortunately we realized that we had this problem too late to fix it in V1, so we plan to fix it in V2 instead.
* The "Break Panel" buttons in the kit assembly manager and gantry manager do not do anything. We will add this functionality in V2.
* The robot arm grippers move linearly despite their bodies moving in a circle. This is the intended behavior and we do not intend to "fix" it because it simplifies the networking code for the robot arms.
