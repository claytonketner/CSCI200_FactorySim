This program is designed to provide GUI support to a kitting cell that assembles kits full of parts for use
 by other assembly cells.  There will be one server application to interact with the back end of the kitting
 cell and track the state of each of the cell’s devices.  There will be several client applications that will
 serve as a GUI for various humans needing to interact with the kitting cell.  These client applications will
 communicate with the server application to display the state of various cell devices to their respective 
user.  They will also take input to send configuration information to the cell. Figure 1 below shows what the
 factory production manager’s monitoring screen will look like.
