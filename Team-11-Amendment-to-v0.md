### Summary

Those of us in charge of the design doc missed one of the emails saying what one of the group members did, so the V0 section of the Contributors page on the design doc was a little out of date at the submission time. To give a better idea of who did what for V0, below is the updated "V0 Milestone" section of the "Contributors" page on the wiki:
